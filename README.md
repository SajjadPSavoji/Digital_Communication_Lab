Here are some implementations of linear and non-linear digital modulations using MATLAB.
Lab 4:
    Implementation of M-PAM, M-PSK, and M-QAM constellations.
    Implementation of M-PAM transmitter and receiver.
Lab 5:
    Channel Modeling.
    Implementation of M-PSK transmitter and receiver.
    Adding and compensation of channel time delay and channel phase offset.
Lab 6:
    Implementation of M-FSK constellation.
    Implementation of M-FSK "Coherent" transmitter and receiver.
Lab 7:
    Implementation of DBPSK modulation.
    Implementation of "Non-Coherent" transmitter and receiver for M-FSK and DBPSK (testing with phase noise).
